                    <p class="pt-1 pb-3">
                        Therapeutic massage is treatment that is more focused on dealing with a specific issue or injury. The pressure and technique will vary depending on the individual, but the goal is resolution of the issue.
                        It is especially helpful for chronically tense and contracted areas such as stiff neck, back and shoulders, TMJ, Sciatica, Tendonitis, and other overuse injuries. The treatment can be uncomfortable, so communicate with your therapist during the treatment and to report any lasting discomfort post-treatment.

                    <h3>Osteopathy</h3>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-3">
                        Osteopathy is an extremely gentle form of treatment that is suitable for everyone including infants and elderly. 

                        In Canada, Osteopathic Manual Practitioners complete a rigorous  program of clinical and academic study in osteopathic manipulation. They treat patients using manual techniques only. They do not use drugs, medication, surgery or other medical procedures.



                        What can Osteopathy Help? 



                        Neck and Back Pain

                        Osteopathic manual practitioners can relieve neck and back pain like sciatica, rib pain, torticollis, headaches and migraines. They can work deeply on the muscles and tendons when required. 



                        Joint pain

                        Shoulder pain and mobility restriction, tennis elbow, carpal tunnel syndrome, hip pain and mobility restrictions, knee problems, ankle or foot pain. 



                        Visceral Treatments

                        Osteopathic approach does not only concentrate on the spine and the structural aspects of the body but integrates the organs. This is why it can help with digestive disorders (constipation, diarrhea, stomach pain, acid reflux and heartburn) or urinary and gynecological issues. 



                        Head related Problems

                        Using cranial techniques, Osteopaths treat various conditions that are often not addressed by other therapies. Jaw pain and tempomandibular disorders, ear, nose and throat problems like chronic ear infections, recurrent sore throats, frequent colds, glaucoma, sinusitis or tinnitus. 



                        Pregnancy

                        A pregnant woman sees her body undergo multiple transformations: the digestive organs are pushed up with the increased volume of the uterus, the bladder is compressed, and the pelvis changes significantly, there is an increase supply of blood and lymph and many hormonal changes. Therefore women often experience lower and upper back pain, heartburn, rib pain and breathing issues, edema and swelling. The osteopathic treatment helps the body making the necessary adjustments. And remember that relaxed muscles and a free pelvis will be the basis for an easy delivery.

                    <h3>Acupuncture</h3>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-3">
                        Relaxing, balancing and rejuvenating. Acupuncture is the insertion of thin, single use needles into specific Acupuncture Points to stimulate the body's own natural healing. We like to think of the needles as a switch; turning off something the body is doing too much of, or turning on something the body is not doing enough. The basic principles of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) teach that all aspect of body and mind need to be in balance to maintain health. Acupuncture is one part of TCM used to restore or maintain that balance. Acupuncture is highly effective in the treatment of insomnia, depression & anxiety, digestive disorders, fertility, PMS, migraines, menopausal symptoms, arthritis, pain, colds & flu, skin disorders, seasonal allergies, smoking cessation and labour induction.
